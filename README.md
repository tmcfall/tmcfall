- 👋 Hi, I’m @tmcfall
- 👀 I’m interested in Networking, Cybersecurity, and developing tools to better protect data and everyday tools for the average consumer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write efficient SQL queries, basic JavaScript programming (for website development and applications), 
        and working in Unity to design my first mobile game!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on security applications, database management, and mobile games!

EXTRAS:
  I love music, politics, and everything technology. I strive to not only be well-informed in my day-to-day life, but also in these three fields.
  I welcome any and all discussions and am completely open in my personal life (to a professional extent). I want to meet as many people, have as many conversations
    and learn as much as I can before my short time in this world is finished and I move on to the afterlife. 

  If you want to pick my brain, have open conversations, or just talk, I'm always available!
